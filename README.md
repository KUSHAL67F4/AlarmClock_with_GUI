The file alarmClock.py contains the code needed to build a simple alarm clock on your own. 
The code after execution opens an interface where you need to enter the time for the alarm in "24-hours format" only.
After you enter the time, the countdown starts and once the mentioned time is reached, the alarm plays a sound for 10 seconds to alert you.
